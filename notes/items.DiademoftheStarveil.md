Here is the **Markdown entry** for the **Diadem of the Starveil**, crafted as a Legendary item steeped in political and divine power, closely tied to the High Priestess of Velaria:

---

# 🧭 **Diadem of the Starveil**

---

## **Item Type:**

Wondrous Item (Worn — Circlet / Headpiece)

## **Rarity:**

Legendary

## **Attunement:**

Yes — by a Cleric, and only fully functions for the *reigning High Priestess of Velaria* who must be a Drow and divinely anointed

---

## **Origin / History:**

Forged from the first silver drawn from the sacred moon-veins beneath Velaria and infused with star-essence from the celestial tear of the goddess herself, the **Diadem of the Starveil** is one of the most jealously guarded relics of the Divine Kingdom.

It is passed down only to the ruling High Priestess of Velaria, serving both as a divine conduit and symbol of absolute ecclesiastical authority.

The Diadem is said to "see through lies, veils, and fate itself."

---

## **Description**

A circlet of impossibly fine starmetal, thin yet indestructible, set with three prismatic gems that shimmer like moving constellations. When worn, it causes a faint halo of starlight to outline the wearer’s silhouette in dim conditions. The gems glow softly in the presence of illusion, enchantment, or divine intervention.

---

## **Properties / Abilities**

### ✦ Passive Effects:

* **Advantage on Saving Throws** against **charm, fear, and illusion effects** (mind-altering magic).
* **Stores 3 cleric spells per long rest**
  *Any 1st to 5th-level Cleric spell cast by the wearer may be stored into the Diadem as a bonus action (max 3 at a time).*
  *Stored spells may be released later without expending a spell slot — one per action or bonus action, depending on the spell's casting time.*
* While attuned, the wearer **cannot be surprised** while conscious.

---

### ✦ High Priestess Empowerment *(Conditional)*

> **While worn by a Drow who is the reigning High Priestess of Velaria**, the Diadem unlocks its full divine potential:

* **Grants Truesight to 180 feet** — vision pierces magical darkness, illusions, invisibility, and even transdimensional trickery.
* The wearer always **knows the location of extraplanar entities** within that radius, though not their identities or intent.
* Can cast **Commune** and **Divination** once per day each without material components.

---

### ✦ Charges / Cooldowns:

* 3 Spell Storage Slots – **refresh after a long rest**
* Additional abilities do not require charges (passive or tied to role)

---

## **Cursed Effects:**

The Diadem of the Starveil is bound by divine law and cannot be removed, destroyed, dispelled, or suppressed by any means once attuned. Upon attunement, the diadem permanently fuses to the wearer’s essence — it cannot be unequipped, unearthed, or altered by any spell, ritual, or physical force.

The item’s effects are always active and cannot be blocked or nullified by any magical or nonmagical effect, including antimagic field, dispel magic, or wish. Even Divine Intervention is powerless to sever the bond — the goddess Velaria herself forbids its removal and safeguards it with her will.

If the wearer dies, the diadem instantly disintegrates into fine silver stardust, which vanishes moments later. This residue is utterly inert and cannot be used, reformed, or revived by any known force, spell, or artifact.

This curse is not malevolent in nature, but it is absolute. The diadem chooses and binds itself to its rightful bearer — and none may contest Velaria’s decree.

---

## **Stat Block Enhancements**

* +2 bonus to **Wisdom (Perception)** checks while worn
* Spell Save DC +1 for all Cleric spells

---

## **Role in the World / Story Hooks**

* This Diadem symbolizes rulership of the religious caste of Velaria — without it, no High Priestess is considered truly anointed.
* An enemy faction or rebellious house might seek to claim or destroy it to destabilize the region.
* The artifact could be central to a **prophecy**, activating hidden powers under certain celestial alignments.

---

## **Quotes / Inscriptions / Activation Words**

> *“Let the veil part, and judgment fall.”*
> *(Traditional invocation when donning the Diadem for official rites.)*

> *“Only the eyes that see shadow may bear the weight of stars.”* — *inscribed along the inner rim in Elvish*

---

## **DM Notes**

* Incredibly powerful when in the hands of the "true" wielder — make sure to gate access to High Priestess status tightly.
* The vision extension and truesight make this item ideal for countering powerful illusions, planar encounters, or long-range scrying.
* The spell storage makes it excellent utility-wise without upsetting balance — consider allowing it to evolve with epic quests (e.g., a 4th prismatic gem appears during a lunar eclipse).
