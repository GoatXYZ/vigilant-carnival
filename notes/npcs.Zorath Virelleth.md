## **Goals and Motivations**

- Cement House Virelleth’s dominance over the Council of Shadows  
- Control all prophecy and spiritual succession in Vel’Norath  
- Prevent any change to the divine structure he cannot oversee or influence

---

## **Secrets**

- Forged a prophecy by altering temple records to remove a rival’s bloodline  
- Keeps his exiled twin brother alive in secret — to ensure no other “true heir” rises  
- Uses a hidden sect of agents (the “Sable Choir”) to suppress heretical visions

---

## **Role in the World**

Lord Zorath is one of the most powerful political and spiritual figures in Vel’Norath. His influence shapes law, faith, and future prophecy. He may serve as a manipulative benefactor, orchestrator of high-level conflict, or the central figure behind a divine coup cloaked in ritual legitimacy.

---

## **DM Notes / Plot Hooks**

- Zorath offers to aid the party with prophetic insight — in exchange for a dangerous favor  
- He may become a major antagonist if the players support temple reform or discover hidden prophecy  
- Could attempt to anoint a false High Priestess or broker a secret war between houses  
- May secretly sponsor the players to destroy something he can’t be seen opposing
