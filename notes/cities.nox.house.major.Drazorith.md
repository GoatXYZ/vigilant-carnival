### 🐺 House Drazorith

**Symbol:** A moonlit wolf howling at a shattered mountain
**Description:** Warriors and wardens of the wilderness, House Drazorith guards the borderlands and maintains ancient oaths with the spirits of the land. Fiercely traditional and blunt, they often clash with the more subtle houses.
**Current Leader:** **Warlord Kareth Drazorith** – A battle-hardened commander who has never lost a duel.
