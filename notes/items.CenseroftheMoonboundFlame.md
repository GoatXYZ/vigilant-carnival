# 🧭 **Censer of the Moonbound Flame**

---

## **Item Type:**

Wondrous Item (Holy Symbol, Spellcasting Focus)

## **Rarity:**

Very Rare

## **Attunement:**

Yes — by a Cleric or Paladin devoted to a moon, twilight, or balance-themed deity

---

## **Origin / History:**

Forged in the sacred sanctum of *Sha’Zir Talith* during a lunar convergence not seen for centuries, the **Censer of the Moonbound Flame** was gifted to **High Priestess Lyranna** by her goddess as a mark of divine trust. It binds the aspects of protection and retribution, reflecting the duality of shadow and flame.

Legends say its fire does not burn flesh unless the soul itself is out of balance.

---

## **Description**

A heavy silver censer shaped like a hanging lotus, veined with obsidian and carved with lunar runes that shift subtly under moonlight. Soft embers flicker within even when cold to the touch. When swung during prayer, pale violet smoke swirls outward, forming ghostly flames that leave no heat behind — unless the wielder wills it.

### ✦ Activated Abilities:

* **Moonbound Sanctuary** *(1/day, no spell slot)*

## **DM Notes**

* Ideal artifact to serve as a cleric’s signature item.
* Balances utility and flavor without being game-breaking.
* The full moon enhancement offers strong narrative opportunities (lunar calendars, rituals, etc.).
* Consider evolving the item with divine quests (e.g., gaining a third spell use or absorbing divine essence).
