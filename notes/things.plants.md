## 🕸️ Shadowweave

Shadowweave is a rare, silken thread spun from the breath of twilight itself—whispers of darkness caught between moonlight and memory. Woven by priestesses and shadowbinders under silent stars, it cloaks the wearer in mystery, bends light like truth, and hums softly when magic stirs too close.

## ⭐ Star-silk

Star-silk shimmers like threads pulled from the night sky, impossibly fine and cool to the touch, glowing faintly with the light of forgotten constellations. Said to be spun by lunar moths that drink starlight, it is coveted by mystics and archmages for its ability to anchor dreams, cloak spells, and whisper omens when the veil between worlds thins.

## 🌿 Moonshade Fern

A silver-laced fern that only unfurls beneath magical twilight or moonlight, its fronds glowing with a soft, dreamlike radiance. Revered by seers and ritualists, it is burned in divinatory rites or brewed into potions that reveal hidden truths and illusions cloaked by shadow.

## 🌾 Veilroot

A twisted root veined with violet, exuding a cool mist when sliced. Veilroot grants the ability to step unseen or blur one’s presence, but in excess, its toxins unravel the mind, revealing glimpses of past lives, future fates, or imagined timelines that might have been.

## 🌺 Wraithblossom

A ghostly flower with translucent petals, said to grow only where souls go unburied. When crushed into powder, it grants fleeting sight into the realm of spirits and the dead. Its bloom is both a gift and a warning, often left untouched by all but soul-guides and death priests.

## 🍄 Twilight Mycelia

A bioluminescent fungal network rooted in the dark caverns and roots of Vel'Norath. It glows in tune with emotion—warm in joy, cold in fear—and is used to craft memory-ink, dream potions, and planar stabilizers. It is said the Mycelia knows every secret ever whispered underground.
