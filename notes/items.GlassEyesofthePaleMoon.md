# 🧭 Glass Eyes of the Pale Moon

*Also known as the “Seer’s Eyes” or “Moonbound Lenses”*

---

## **Item Type:**
Wondrous Item (Eyes, magical replacement)

## **Rarity:**
Legendary

## **Attunement:**
Yes — Requires attunement by a Wizard, Cleric, or divination-capable spellcaster who has willingly sacrificed their natural sight

---

## **Origin / History:**

Forged during a sacred lunar eclipse by Archmage Kaelas in a ritual of foresight and sacrifice, these arcane eyes are not mere artifacts—they are anchored starlight and raw divine insight, bound into crystalline form. Gifted to him by the goddess Velaria after offering his natural eyes in exchange for clarity beyond the mortal veil, they are rumored to be partially conscious, whispering the edges of forgotten futures.

No others have ever worn them and survived.

---

## **Description**

Two perfectly smooth spheres of moon-glass, each faintly glowing with soft silver-blue radiance. When attuned, they settle into the wearer’s sockets and cannot be removed without destroying the host. Runes faintly shift across their surfaces when activated, and during divination spells, the light within pulses like a distant star.

## **Properties / Abilities**

### ✦ Passive Effects:

* Grants **Truesight** to 120 ft
* Immune to **blinding**, **gaze attacks**, and **illusory visual effects**
* Can **see into the Ethereal Plane** and detect **invisible** or **divine beings** as faint silhouettes
* While concentrating on a divination spell, the wearer has **resistance to psychic damage**

### ✦ Activated Abilities:

**✧ Moonpierce Vision** *(1/day, Bonus Action)*  
You automatically succeed on one Arcana, Insight, or Perception check involving seeing through deception, illusion, or fate (including magical disguises, false prophecies, or scrying barriers).  
Additionally, for the next minute, you can detect any creature under the effects of *nondetection*, *mislead*, or *greater invisibility* within 60 ft.

**✧ Chrono-Echo** *(1/week, Reaction)*  
When you fail a saving throw against a time or mind-altering effect, you may instead choose to succeed as your vision snaps into a divergent version of the moment. This leaves you dazed until the end of your next turn (no action or reaction).

### ✦ Charges / Cooldowns:
- Moonpierce Vision: 1/day  
- Chrono-Echo: 1/week

## **Cursed Effects (if any):**

Once attuned, the eyes cannot be removed or suppressed by any means short of divine intervention. If the wearer is killed, the eyes crumble into star-dust, leaving no magical residue behind.

---

## **Stat Block Enhancements**

* +2 bonus to spell attack rolls for Divination spells
* Divination spells cast with these eyes active do not require material components (unless they cost 100 gp or more)

---

## **Role in the World / Story Hooks**

* A lesser set of prototype eyes may exist—Kaelas destroyed them… or so he claims.
* The Sable Choir believes removing these eyes would awaken an ancient celestial imprisoned in the stars.
* A rival faction seeks to replicate their power through unethical experimentation on seers and prophets.

## **Quotes / Inscriptions / Activation Words**

> *“The eye sees what is, the will sees what must be.”*  
> *(Carved on the glass dome that once housed the ritual of their creation)*

---

## **DM Notes**

- These eyes grant immense narrative and mechanical power—ideal for high-tier campaigns and epic-level NPCs.
- Could serve as a major campaign objective or key to a divine vault of prophecy.
- Highly situational but exceptionally potent when used wisely; ideal for a "true seer" archetype.
