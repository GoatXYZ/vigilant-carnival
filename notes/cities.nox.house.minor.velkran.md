### 🐉 House Velkran

**Symbol:** A serpent-like dragon with mirrored wings
**Description:** Once powerful, House Velkran fell from major status after the **Great Mist Awakening**, but still retains mastery over draconic bloodlines and beast-binding. Some whisper of their attempt to harness forbidden magic.
**Current Leader:** **Patriarch Draveth Velkran** – Scarred and brooding, seeking restoration of his house's former glory.
