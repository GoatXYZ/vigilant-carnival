## ⛏️ Duskslate Ore

A dark, matte-gray ore threaded with faint glimmers of violet. Found in abundance throughout the lower reaches of the Shadowpeak Mountains, Duskslate is sturdy, easy to refine, and resistant to corrosion — making it a favored material for armor, tools, and basic enchanted gear. Though common, when alloyed with lunar salts or alchemical catalysts, it can carry minor enchantments with surprising efficiency.

## ✨ Umbrylite

A rare and radiant ore found only in deep faultlines beneath sacred mountain veins. Umbrylite pulses faintly with internal light—like a frozen star trapped in stone—and is attuned to both lunar and shadow energies. Smiths of the Moonshadow Academy forge it into blades that sing in silence, rings that anchor planar stability, and relics worthy of divine wielders. Each vein uncovered is considered a sign of Velaria’s favor.
