# ✨ Spell: *Astral Rupture*

---

## **Level:** 9th  
## **School:** Divination (Celestial)  
## **Casting Time:** 1 action  
## **Range:** 120 feet  
## **Components:** V, S, M (a shard of crystal that has never reflected light, consumed)  
## **Duration:** Instantaneous

---

## **Description:**

You call upon the divine constellation of lost futures, rending the boundary between what *is* and what *should never have been*. Threads of starlit energy tear down from the heavens, lancing into a creature you can see within range and exposing it to all the damage it would have suffered across every fate it was spared.

Celestial light fractures around the target, revealing ghostly silhouettes of alternate versions of itself — each suffering a different fate. For each fate, pain, ruin, and divine retribution are condensed into a single impossible instant.

---

## **Effect:**

Choose one creature within range. That creature must make a **Wisdom saving throw** twice. On a failure, it takes:

- **12d10 radiant damage**  
- **6d10 psychic damage**

On a success, it takes half as much damage and is not affected by the secondary effects.

If the target is a fiend, aberration, or undead, it has **disadvantage** on the saving throw.

---

### **Secondary Effects on Failed Save:**

- The target is **blinded and stunned** and will have **disadvantage** until the end of its next turn.  
- For 1 minute, the creature cannot benefit from invisibility, illusions, or nondetection effects.  
- The next time the creature attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed on a **DC 20 Constitution saving throw** or the spell fails and is lost.

---

## **At Higher Levels:**

This spell cannot be cast using spell slots of lower levels.

---

## **Spell Tags:** Damage, Celestial, Divination, Radiant, Psychic, Anti-Invisibility

---

## **DM Notes:**

- This spell is devastating but thematically specific — designed for legendary moments or divine-scale confrontations.  
- Its narrative weight makes it perfect for use in cutscenes or as a show of Kaelas’s full might.  
- Optional visual: constellations above the target rearrange mid-cast to spell out the creature’s true name in Celestial script.
